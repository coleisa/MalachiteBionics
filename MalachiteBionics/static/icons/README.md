# Placeholder for notification icons
# In production, you would add actual icon files:
# - icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
# - badge-72x72.png (72x72 pixels)
# - notification-sound.mp3 (optional)

# For now, the browser will use default icons if these files are missing.
# You can add custom icons by creating PNG files with the appropriate sizes.
